<p>I am a young game/software developer in Espoo, Finland. I graduated from Tampere University of Applied Sciences at the end of 2015, served my time as a conscript in Finnish Defence forces as a ADL-developer and am currently working remotely as a part-time Unity developer in a company based in Tampere.</p>

<h1>
<a id="skills" class="anchor" href="#skills" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Skills</h1>

<p>I am mainly a game developer, and specifically I have mostly been using Unity3D, so most of my skills acquired outside school are game development related. I specialised in software development when studying, so most of my courses consisted of traditional development in Java, C++ and others, so I have solid understanding of OOP and different design patterns.</p>

<h2>
<a id="programming-languages" class="anchor" href="#programming-languages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming languages</h2>

<p>Java and C# are the languages I am most proficient with. Most of my programming courses that introduced new methods were in Java and most of my hobby and work experience is in C# and Unity3D. I have studied web technologies, such as HTML, HTML5, JavaScript and PHP. I have knowledge of server configuring, programming client-server connections and using databases with SQL manually or through web requests.</p>

<h2>
<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h2>

<p>I have mostly been developing using Unity3D, and I think of myself as proficient Unity user. I am familiar with making editor extensions, plugins, serializations and such. Most of the time I open up Unity when I have free time and just try to make something new and silly.</p>

<p>As mobile development goes, I am familiar with Android SDK components for building and logging, xCode, in conjunction with Unity, and without. I have also developed native application on Android and tried my hand in Android Wear development, so the workflow in familiar.</p>

<p>I am no graphics designer, but I have been to courses on Photoshop and tried on making the graphics for my own projects, so I am familiar with Photoshop, GIMP, Illustrator, After Effects and 3D modeling with Sculpture, ScetchUp, Blender and 3DS Max.</p>

<h2>
<a id="project-and-management" class="anchor" href="#project-and-management" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project and management</h2>

<p>All of my teamwork experience is from projects using agile methods. Mostly something closely resembling SCRUM. I have courses on different agile development methods and traditional waterfall model. For management I have been using free software and services, like Trello and BitBucket/GitHub.</p>

<a id="projects-and-work-experience" class="anchor" href="#projects-and-work-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects and work experience</h1>

<p>I only have a few shipped projects under my belt and all of them are from the time I was still studying. I have actively been doing my own projects, but most of them stay as prototypes or tests. Mostly as an excuse I have been telling myself I don't have enough time to finish them, but also the lack of aesthetic eye has a part in it.</p>

<a id="first-published-project---websnap" class="anchor" href="#first-published-project---websnap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First published project - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.tamk.quido3.websnap&amp;hl=en">WebSnap</a>
</h2>

<p>This was the very first bigger project we did in school. It is a native android application written in Java. The goal of the project was to make a application that would enable me to get a piece of a guide site for League of Legends in my phones home screen so I would always see the free champion rotation. Lol was all the craze back then(Still playing from time to time btw). I had a few apps in my phone that could technically do this, but they used a method to select HTML elements in the site and just fetch those every time the widget updated. I got to the conclusion that this method was a pain for the user and decided to find a way to get an actual image out of the site. I implemented a mask that the user would position in the site, a screenshot and crop functions and all the UI needed for this. The application is working and usable, but has a few crashing bugs and has to show the full page every time it updates the widget. Never got back to the project and it had to be shipped by the end if the course, so that's the state it was left in.</p>

<p>These two projects were made to Finlands Metsähallitus's science center Pilke for use at their fair stands. These are two games specifically meant to be played in a iPad 2 placed in a metallic stand and used mainly by younger audience. The ideas for both originated from the science centre operator and the head of the science centre at Pilke and were iterated with me and my friend that was working with me on the games.</p>

<p>Both games are accessible in iTunes <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bio-cruising/id916699945?mt=8">here</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tuksu-man/id908988279?mt=8">here</a>.</p>

<a id="kyy-games" class="anchor" href="#kyy-games" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kyy games</h2>

<p>This was a summer trainee position for the last part of my education. Kyy games is a game studio in Tampere. Biggest own product must be <a href="https://www.cabalsgame.com/">Cabals: Magic &amp; Battle Cards</a> and they were at the time working with Paradox Interactive on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paradoxplaza.kopp2&amp;hl=en">Knights of Pen and Paper 2</a>. I was working on a new dice based puzzle game, a desktop version of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/store/p/cabals-legends/9nblggh0k45z#">Cabals Legends</a>, QA of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.powerpark.trulon&amp;hl=en">Trulon - The shadow Engine</a> and testing of other titles. </p>

<p>This was my conscript time. I got selected to the ADL-team based in Tuusula and was to work on a first project on a suite of educational games meant to possibly replace some classes at the beginning of a new conscripts serving time and teach some basic skills in a new and more engaging way. The end result was a complete 3D game where the user can shoot and adjust the sights of the same weapon used in the real drill in a 3D enviroment and see the actual result when shooting again. This has not released yet, but is undergoing small changes in the hands of the new conscripts in the ADL-team and will be released by Finnish Defence forces in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="http://exerium.com/">Exerium</a> is the company I made my thesis work Interaction in Games from the Developer’s Viewpoint. I worked in a project for Exerium with two other student where we implemented a simple targeting/shooting game for Android tablets that would be used in rehabilitation using the <a href="http://exerium.com/gamexr/">GameXR</a> gaming chair by Exerium. After the project in 2015 I started working as a part-time next to writing my thesis, conscript time and are still working here.</p>
